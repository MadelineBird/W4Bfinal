                Why we started The Farmacy <br> <br>As a young girl, our founder Madeline Bird (pictured left), dreamed of being a flower farmer somewhere in Oregon. Flowers of every shape and size always brought her happiness and she wanted to share that happiness with the world. <br> <br> As Madeline got older she saw a need for rest and renewal and realized she could dream bigger than just a flower farm. With a love for farming and holistic wellness she opened The Farmacy- a wellness center that specializes in reestablishing the mind-body connection through fresh food, relaxation, and fields and fields of flowers.
